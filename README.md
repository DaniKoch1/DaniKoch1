## Welcome

I am Daniela and I am passionate about XR technology. My interest landed me a job as a software developer and UX designer at ESI where I am developing a software called IC.IDO. Additionally, to deepen my knowledge and challenge myself I have recently started a MSc in Medialogy at AAU in Copenhagen, Denmark.

I use this repository for my student projects. This semester I will be focusing on Machine Learning for media experiences, Mobile and Wearable Computing and Realtime Computer Graphics. What is more, I will develop a bigger Adaptive Media Experience project. My goal is to explore how XR technology can lift the fields of education and mental health to a higher level.

Stay tuned and happy coding!
